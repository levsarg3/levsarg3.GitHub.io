			<h1>Design Principles in Mobile Sites</h1>
			<!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs four items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- The site name used in the picture
4- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed!

			<h2>Proximity &mdash; Payton Smith</h2>

            </p>
			<p>
				The principles of proximity is exemplified in the way that Zumies has grouped together the different genders and types of cloths to make searching faster and more efficient. It would be a mess if the guys and girls cloths were all mixed together. They have also put groups of certain deals, brands, and types of cloths. This way they are able to group things together to help catch peopleâ€™s attention and help the experience be more user friendly.

			<h2>Alignment &mdash; Joshua Elliot</h2>

				The Frugal Girls
			</p>
            
			<p>
				I found that this website has good alignment because the white space added to it and is an over all good mobile site.
			</p>

			<h2>Repetition &mdash; Levi Sargeant</h2>

			<p>
				GoNintendo demonstrates a great example of repetition through the site by keeping things simple, but uniform. It organizes information that the target audience is looking for (i.e. the latest rumors on Nintendo's new console, reviews for a particular game that recently released, or other relevant information) in simple, labeled boxes to navigate with that lead the user to different sections of the website that focus on that subject. Also, with every news entry found on the website has a consistent ellipse design that gives the site a fun personality, an appropriate reflection of what video games, especially from Nintendo, are meant to be. No matter how old the news gets, the design stays the same, as it is meant to be!

			<h2>Contrast &mdash; Kean Vegas</h2>

				Imgur
			</p>
			<p>
				When first visiting Imgur.com on a mobile, you come to a black background with contrasting gray colors to label the toolbars against the hosted pictures. The website is highly optimized for mobile use, and allows for quick movement through the different pictures and pages. By pressing on the 3 bars on the top left it has a drop down menu that allows you to go to the home, search the site, sign in, register an account, give feedback, apply for a job, and access their Imgur store. It is also where they list their footer containing their ToS, desktop view and to open the app.

			<h2>Typography &mdash; Mike Shoaf</h2>
			<img src="/images/walmart.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
			<p>
				Walmart
			</p>
			<p>
				Walmart goes about using a sans serif approach. It bolds the information for the target audience that they feel is most important; i.e. prices and products. It uses a smaller unbolded font to compare prices. It also uses different colors to draw your attention in different way. Red, for example, is what you save. Red also states important, which is most likely why they used it for savings. It uses a capitalized approach to state other important things; i.e. FREE shipping.
