				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
				<p>The first thing that I find with GoNintendo is that it presents itself exactly as what is said on the tin: This is a website all about giving you the latest in news related to Nintendo in anyway. "Dedicated" is the best word to describe this site! The thing that makes this site shine though is how it demonstrates the princple of repetition.</p>
                
                <p>GoNintendo demonstrates a great example of repetition through the site by keeping things simple, but uniform. It organizes information that the target audience is looking for (i.e. the latest rumors on Nintendo's new console, reviews for a particular game that recently released, or other relevant information) in simple, labeled boxes to navigate with that lead the user to different sections of the website that focus on that subject. Also, with every news entry found on the website has a consistent ellipse design that gives the site a fun personality, an appropriate reflection of what video games, especially from Nintendo, are meant to be. No matter how old the news gets, the design stays the same, as it is meant to be!</p>

				<h2>Persona</h2>
				
				<p>The kind of guy this website is geared towards is a twenty something year old who probably wears shirts with Mario or The Legend of Zelda on them. He played Nintendo games way back in the day where sometimes he had to blow into the cartridge to make the darn game play! Since then, he's been faithful in picking up Nintendo consoles all the way to the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, the latest offerings released by Nintendo, with other news that might interest him like fan art, music, or anything else Nintendo related. This site was designed for that guy!</p>

            <h2>Bad Example of Repetition</h2>
                
                <p>Where do I even begin with this site? It looks like it was meant to be boring to look at. All the ironically designed asthetics aside, the way this site demonstrates repetition is just bland and sometimes inconsistent. Unlike a website like GoNintendo that goes for a uniform approach, you're getting different lengthed blocks of text that at times confused me at what I wanted to look at. The fact that this site seems that it was designed to look boring doesn't redeem itself in that department. All I got was claustrophobically clumped links to funny things that doesn't look appealing at all.</p>
